# aiohug

I like convenient API, and one of them it's hug. I missed something like this for aiohttp. Â 

>Talk is cheap. Show me the code.

Firstly, let's imagine what we want to have:

```python
@routes.get("/hello/{name}/")
async def hello(name: fields.String(), greeting: fields.String() = "Hello"):
    return {"msg": f"{greeting}, {name}"

# or 

class PayloadSchema(Schema):
    count = fields.Int()

@routes.get("/")
async def with_body(body: PayloadSchema()):
    return body
```


Okay, now  remember how looks simple application with aiohttp



aiohttp support declarative handler registration



After previous gist I will skip some boilerplate code for app creation.
Arguments
Ok, we need get argument from url?



with aiohug



What if wee need argument in query?
